# What is this?

When I'm working on learning a new language, I like to work out some of these
programming brain-teasers in the language.

It's a good way to understand the finer points of the syntax, and by looking at
other people's solutions after I solve them, I can get an idea of more idiomatic
ways of writing that might take me longer to come across ordinarily.
