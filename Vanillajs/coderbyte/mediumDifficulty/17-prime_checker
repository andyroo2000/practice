/*

Have the function PrimeChecker(num) take num and return 1 if any arrangement of num comes out to be a prime number, otherwise return 0. For example: if arr is 910, the output should be 1 because 910 can be arranged into 109 or 019, both of which are primes.

Correct Sample Outputs
Input = 98   Output = 1
Input = 598  Output = 1
