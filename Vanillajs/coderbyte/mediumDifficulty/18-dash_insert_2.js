/*

Have the function DashInsertII(num) insert dashes ('-') between each two odd numbers and insert asterisks ('*') between each two even numbers in num. For example: if num is 4546793 the output should be 454*67-9-3. Don't count zero as a negative or positive number.

Correct Sample Outputs
Input = 99946     Output = "9-9-94*6"
Input = 56647304  Output = "56*6*47-304"
